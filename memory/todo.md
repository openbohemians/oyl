# TODO

*Updated 2026-10-13*

Small deferred tasks: each is agreed or obvious, but none is planned yet.
Larger features go in ideas.md, and the order of work in roadmap.md.

- **Public `oyl_tree_json`** (**Open**). The tree design sketch has
  `oyl_status oyl_tree_json(const oyl_tree *t, unsigned flags, oyl_str
  *json)`, for JSON from a tree a program already holds. It wasn't built
  in tree step 2 (`480bf4d`) because `oyl_parse_json` writes JSON from a
  tree internally (oyl_json.c, `write_node`). It's small: expose that
  writer over a given tree. Add it when the Go library or parallel JSON
  (each thread writing its own documents) needs it. The user asked for
  this note, 2026-10-13.
- **Emitter: no trailing space after `- `** (**Open**). A block sequence
  inside a block sequence is written `- ` + newline. That's valid YAML,
  but it leaves trailing whitespace. Seen 2026-10-12 while testing
  `oyl_emit_tree`. Possibly write the compact form instead (`- - x`).
- **oyl.go: a wrapper .c for `oyl_tree.c`** (**Open**). oyl.go needs one
  wrapper per vendored source file. Add it when oyl.go vendors a release
  with trees (1.2.0).
